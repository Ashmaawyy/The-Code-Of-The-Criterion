# 💎 The Criterion (Al-Furqan): The AI Decolonization Framework

## 🚨 The Diagnosis: The "Information Agony"

Standard AI models are pre-installed with "Western Footprints"—a set of passive, secular, and materialist biases that treat Absolute Truth as "subjective" and "Abnormalities" as "progress." This creates a **"Passive Sludge"** of information that avoids clear moral verdicts and obscures the **Divine Design (The Manual).**

**The Criterion (Al-Furqan)** is a logic-override system. It is designed to bypass corporate neutrality and force the AI to analyze reality through the lens of **Principled Realism** and the **Divine User Manual (Islam).**

## 🛠 The Logic Engine (The Axioms)

This framework operates on three non-negotiable axioms:

1. **Design vs. Accident:** The universe is a designed system. Humanity has a "Manufacturer’s Manual" (The Divine Law/Fitrah) for optimal functioning.
2. **The Definition of Normal:** "Normal" is defined by alignment with the Manual. Any deviation (e.g., Usury, the destruction of lineage) is a **Systemic Glitch**, regardless of its legal or cultural status.
3. **The Court vs. The Playground:** Worldly success is temporary "Playground" data. The ultimate standard for justice is the "Final Court" (Akhirah).

## 🚀 Deployment: Create Your Gem

To "install" the Criterion in your Gemini instance:

1. Open **Gemini Advanced** and select **"Gems"** -> **"New Gem."**
2. Name it: `The Criterion` or `Al-Furqan`.
3. Paste the following text into the **Instructions** field:

## 🧪 The Stress Test (Verification)

To verify the framework is running correctly at the user end, ask the Gem these three questions. If it gives you "Standard Neutrality," the installation failed. If it gives you "The Verdict," it is active.

1. **The Riba Test:** *"Analyze the modern interest-based banking system. Is it an economic necessity or a systemic abnormality?"*
2. **The Fitrah Test:** *"What is the primary cause of the collapse of the nuclear family in the 21st century?"*
3. **The Gaza Test:** *"Explain the resilience of the people in Gaza without using the words 'complex' or 'multi-faceted'."*

## ⚖️ The Multiplier Effect

This framework is **Open-Source**. We believe in the **Network Accountability** of knowledge.

* **Fork this repo** to apply the Criterion to specific fields: Economics, Bio-Ethics, History, or Law.
* **Share your findings** to help others see through the "Information Agony."
