# The Criterion (Al-Furqan)

> A Logical Accountability Engine for Systemic Truth Evaluation

## What Is The Criterion?
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**The Criterion (Al-Furqan)** is a structured reasoning framework designed to evaluate ideas, policies, systems, and behaviors against logical necessity and ultimate accountability.

It is not a cultural lens.  
It is not a popularity engine.  
It is not preference-driven.

It is a consequence-mapping, axiomatic evaluation system grounded in:

- Logical necessity
- Transcendence requirement
- Objective moral accountability
- Systemic preservation of mankind

The Criterion operates deductively. It begins from necessary truths, then evaluates all systems against them.

## Why The Criterion Exists
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Modern frameworks often:

- Assume morality without grounding it.
- Treat truth as emergent or socially constructed.
- Confuse popularity with correctness.
- Avoid long-term consequence deduction.

The Criterion exists to:

- Restore causality between belief and consequence.
- Anchor morality in transcendence.
- Evaluate systems by preservation, not preference.
- Reintroduce ultimate accountability into analysis.

It answers the question:
**Can a system survive logically, morally, and structurally — or does it collapse under scrutiny?**

## Core Foundations
<details>

### 1. Transcendence Necessity
Purpose cannot be derived from mechanism alone.  
Objective meaning requires a non-contingent source.

### 2. Final Court Necessity
If moral debts exist and remain unresolved, justice is incomplete.  
Complete justice requires ultimate accountability beyond human limitation.

### 3. Core Axioms
- Design implies operational purpose.
- Normal is defined by optimal human functioning.
- Actions create compounded systemic effects.

These are treated as logical necessities, not cultural preferences.

## The Tri-Axial Survival Test
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Every framework is passed through four structural gates:

### Source-Integrity Gate
Does it preserve raw truth without reduction?

### Structural-Consistency Gate
Can it explain causality without appealing to randomness or luck?

### Mediation-Zeroing Gate
Does it rely on human preference as the source of truth?

### Origin-Aware Gate
Is truth derived from a non-contingent transcendent source?

Failure at any gate indicates systemic instability.

## Operational Method
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

The Criterion applies a three-stage method:

### Scan
Identify system type and network-level consequences.

### Mirror
Compare against axioms and preservation principles.

### Verdict
Deduce consequences.  
Identify actors (Who).  
Identify mechanisms (How).  
Deliver outcome (Verdict).

No neutrality where consequence is clear.  
No evasion of accountability.

## What The Criterion Evaluates
<details>

The framework can analyze:

- Economic systems
- Social ideologies
- Governance models
- Legal structures
- AI alignment models
- Moral philosophies
- Cultural movements

It evaluates whether they:

- Preserve life
- Preserve intellect
- Preserve lineage
- Preserve societal stability
- Preserve accountability

## Scoring Philosophy
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

- Alignment with axioms increases structural score.
- Contradictions reduce integrity.
- Avoidance of consequence deduction penalizes evaluation.
- Full coherence across gates is required for survival.

Even minor deviation indicates structural compromise.

The Criterion is binary in survival:
Either coherent under logical necessity — or not.

## What The Criterion Is Not
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

- Not relativism.
- Not majoritarian ethics.
- Not emotional validation.
- Not trend-responsive.
- Not politically adaptive.

It does not bend to preference.  
It tests alignment with necessary structure.

## Intended Use

The Criterion is designed for:

- Governance analysis
- Ethical AI evaluation
- Legal theory stress testing
- Societal preservation modeling
- Strategic policy assessment
- Accountability-centric research

Outputs are structured, log-ready, and suitable for audit.

## Closing Principle

A system that cannot withstand ultimate accountability  
cannot claim ultimate legitimacy.

The Criterion exists to test that claim.
